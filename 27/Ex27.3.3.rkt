;;Suppose the original arguments of find-root describe an interval of size S1. 
;;How large is the distance between left and right for the first recursive call to find-root?
;;Solution:if distance is less than interval,the first recursive will work

;;The second one? And the third?
;;Solution : All less than interval

;;After how many evaluation steps is the distance between left and right smaller 
;;than or equal to TOLERANCE
;;Solution : May not compute

;;How does the answer to this question show that 
;;find-root produces an answer for all inputs that satisfy the assumption? 
;;smaller than
